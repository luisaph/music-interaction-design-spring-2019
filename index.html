title: Music Interaction Design
---
<div class="row">
	<div class="span8">
		<p>In this class students develop interactive music projects: pieces of music that are not linear, but rather offer multiple dimensions for listeners to explore ––on their phones in a crowded subway, at an abandoned factory in Palermo, back on their couches after a long day, or at a classical concert hall. </p>

		<p>Students will take a project from concept to execution over several iterations, applying music production, interaction design, and creative coding tools and techniques. During the first half of the semester, they will gather aural and visual references, compose graphic notations, and create interactive studies to explore specific elements of their composition. This work will lead to the implementation of the midterm project: a functional, high-fidelity prototype. For their final projects, students will evaluate their midterm pieces from the perspectives of music, visual / tactile and interaction design, and refine them to produce an engaging piece of interactive music.</p>

		<p>ICM or equivalent experience is required. Some experience in making or producing music will be useful, but is not required.</p>
