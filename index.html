title: Music Interaction Design
---
<div class="row">
	<div class="span8">
		<p>In this class students develop interactive music projects: pieces of music that are not linear, but rather offer multiple dimensions for listeners to explore ––on their phones in a crowded subway, at an abandoned factory in Palermo, back on their couches after a long day, or at a classical concert hall. </p>

		<p>Students will take a project from concept to execution over several iterations, applying music production, interaction design, and creative coding tools and techniques. During the first half of the semester, they will gather aural and visual references, compose graphic notations, and create interactive studies to explore specific elements of their composition. This work will lead to the implementation of the midterm project: a functional, high-fidelity prototype. For their final projects, students will evaluate their midterm pieces from the perspectives of music, visual / tactile and interaction design, and refine them to produce an engaging piece of interactive music.</p>

		<p>ICM or equivalent experience is required. Some experience in making or producing music will be useful, but is not required.</p>

				<p>1. Fill in <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/YE7bdiK5DgxZw6Pu1">this poll</a> re: software licenses (thank you!)</p>
				<p>2. Teach yourself Ableton Live (if you are not already a user). I recommend following these lessons from Help / Help View: 
					<ul>
						<li>A tour of Live</li>
						<li>Recording Audio</li>
						<li>Creating Beats</li>
						<li>Playing Software Instruments</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>3. Start working on your project:
					<ul>
						<li>Refine your prompt: who is your project for? Are you a part of this group of people? Is someone close to you (a classmate, friend or family member)? Can you find someone to play test your project and give you feedback?</li>
						<li>Make an aural mood board: a collection of reference audio clips. This should be in a format that you can easily share with the class in under two minutes (include short clips rather than full pieces or recordings). You can annotate them to indicate why you included each clip.</li>
						<li>Create a musical user path: what does it sound like to experience your project, to one user, during one particular interaction session? If you like, you can add a second path to illustrate a range of possible experiences. Whatever process you use to create each path, the result should be a rendered audio file. Remember this is a first draft: the idea is that you start considering duration, musical elements, arcs, sections (if any), and so on. There is no expectation of production polish at this point. <!-- To focus the design process on the musical experience of the user. --> </li>

				<p>1. Music Teaching Tools: Harmony. Make some music using the following: 
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/hookpad/app">Chord Progressions</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/Arpeggios/">Arpeggios</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/chords/major-triads.html">Chords</a></li> 
					</ul>
					Write a short response discussing your experience. 
				</p>
				<p>2. Do a second pass on your musical user path exploring tools for manipulating harmony and timbre. For example: 
					<ul>
						<li>Harmony: MIDI effects: Chord, Arpeggiator</li>
						<li>Synthesis: Analog, Operator</li>
						<li>Sampling: Simpler, Sampler, Granulator</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>3. Create additional, alternative user paths to illustrate the range of interaction experiences your project might offer. Start thinking of interactions: what user actions will determine which musical outcomes? What aspects of the music will evolve independently of user actions (if any)?</p>
				<!-- <p>4. Optional: connect a MIDI controller to Ableton, and start prototyping the interaction.</p> -->

				<p>1. Apply Verplank's IxD framework to your project - a second pass, after getting feedback from your partner in class. Remember you are not limited to just one metaphor, scenario, control, etc.</p>
				<p>2. Place your project on the 7-axis dimension space diagram. What features are a priority to you? To your target audience? Feel free to change the number of axes and the dimension they represent.</p>
				<p>3. Describe at least three feel/know/do cycles for your project. Be specific. Prototype at least two, and have someone else try it. Your prototype can take any form, including you acting as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment">Wizard of Oz</a>. Document your test and findings.</p>
